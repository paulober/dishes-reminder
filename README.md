\f0\fs36 \cf0 Don\'92t know what to cook? Here is the solution, save every dish you eat in the app and if you eat it again mark it as \'93eaten-again\'94 so you can question the app every time you don\'92t know what to cook and see what you haven\'92t eaten for the longest time.\

The app currently only features a German translation.}
